# FEL-NLP-IR_2016

Source code for 2016 Information Retrieval homeworks (ÃšFAL-taught course for FEL)

We are providing this code to help you get to the "meat" of the assignments faster, 
without having to write all the pesky parsing methods. 

Installation
============

There is a standard Python setup script (`setup.py`) to install. Use `python setup.py --develop` 
to have changes to the code in your working directory reflected directly in the installation.

The package name, `npfl103`, is an old designation of a similar course at MFF.
I'm using it because I don't know what your course designation is, plus it seems
quite certain that this will not generate a naming conflict.


First steps
===========

There is an Ipython Notebook file that provides a tutorial:

`tutorial.ipynb`

Fire up Jupyter and go through the tutorial to learn the basics. It should take about 15 minutes.
